          <p>CallCongress.how has been a project of mine for some time. Initially envisioned as a static site serving up phone scripts to make calling congresspeople easier for those who may not be at their most eloquent on the phone, it's evolved over time into a tool that can be used to build political momentum, keep voters informed about their legislators' activity, and bring like-minded people together.</p>
          <p>In the far future, my vision for CallCongress.how includes a national network of people working to provide information on local politics in real time.</p>
